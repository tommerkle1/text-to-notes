# textmybot

i want to text my bot.

## function
personal digital assistant that works 
    
## features

- takes notes in a customizable location, by category. First should determine intent, and then route the note to a location, classified based on determined intent

- set reminders for bot to respond at a future date / time

- set event on calendar

## long shot
other people can interact with my assistant? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gFSENorEY) lol
